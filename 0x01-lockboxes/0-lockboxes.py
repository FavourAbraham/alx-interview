Module to determine if all boxes can be opened.

def canUnlockAll(boxes):
    """
    Determines if all the boxes can be opened starting from the first box.

    This function uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the boxes.
    It begins with the first box (index 0) and uses a queue to manage the boxes
    that need to be checked. As keys are found, they are used to open new boxes
    and add them to the queue for further exploration.

    Args:
        boxes (list of list of int): A list where each element is a list of integers representing keys
                                     to other boxes. The index of the list represents the box number.

    Returns:
        bool: True if all boxes can be opened, False otherwise.

    Example:
        boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
        canUnlockAll(boxes) -> True

        boxes = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
        canUnlockAll(boxes) -> True

        boxes = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
        canUnlockAll(boxes) -> False
